## equip-1 0.1 alpha

Hardware:

- Radxa 2f 2Gb RAM 8Gb eMMC (Raspberry Pi needs testing)
- [Rasperry Pi 5 PCIe Hat](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005007875203834.html) (Compatible with the 2f)
- [VIA VT6315N Firewire card](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005005044278296.html)
- A good firewire cable (Sometimes there are these transparent cables delivered with the firewire card, they did not work for me!)

Software:

- [Rock 2f Custom Firewire Armbian Image](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kLxVSK0Dhzc2q1MnAXW4JjSZa23EkOea?usp=sharing)
- [DVGrab](https://github.com/ddennedy/dvgrab)

### Install custom OS

[Use this guide](https://docs.radxa.com/en/rock2/rock2f/getting-started/install-os/maskrom) to install the provided image on the 2f.
The provided image has the custom firewire kernels already installed, created by the [armbian-build tool](https://github.com/armbian/build). The folder also contains the SPI loader file, which is needed for flashing the OS on the 2f. Disconnect the 2f after you finished the installation.

### Connect the hardware and first boot

Attach the hat on the 2f, connect the ffc cable, and slide the firewire card in the PCIe connector.

Connect the 2f to a screen and keyboard and then boot it. Go through the setup.

Use `lspci` to check if the firewire card got recognized.

### DVGrab and recording

If the firewire card shows up, it is now time to install DVGrab.

```
sudo apt install dvgrab
```

Connect your camera to the setup and turn it on (Camera mode).

Enter this command to start capturing:

```
dvgrab -buffers 20 name-
```

You are now capturing DV footage via firewire on a self build device!

To end the recording press `ctrl + c` and the .dv file will be saved in the destination, where you started the command from.

### Making it portable

Adding a NEEWER 10,500 mAh NP-F970 battery allows this setup to be powered via the USB-C port.
To control the device, a small button and an OLED screen are added using the GPIO pins of the 2F.
